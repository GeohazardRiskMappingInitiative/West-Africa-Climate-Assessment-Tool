## MODIS Land Surface Temperature (LST) Viewer for Ghana

### Overview

This project is a Google Earth Engine (GEE) application that visualizes and analyzes Land Surface Temperature (LST) data for Ghana. It allows users to select a year and month, visualize LST data, and view a time series of LST values for specific locations. The tool also provides a user-friendly interface for interaction, making it easy to explore the MODIS LST dataset over the region.

### Goals

Visualize LST Data: Allow users to view MODIS Land Surface Temperature (LST) data for Ghana.

Interactive Time Series: Let users click on the map to view a time series of LST values for any location in Ghana.

User-friendly Interface: Provide a well-structured, clean UI for year and month selection, data visualization, and chart generation.
